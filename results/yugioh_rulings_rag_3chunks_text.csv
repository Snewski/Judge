### Game State
Player B activates ""Royal Decree"". Player A controls ""Mystical Space Typhoon"".

### Query
Can Player A chain ""Mystical Space Typhoon"" to the activation of ""Royal Decree""?

### Card Text
Mystical Space Typhoon:
  Card Type: Spell Card
  Sub-Type: Quick-Play
  Text: Target 1 Spell/Trap on the field; destroy that target.

Royal Decree:
  Card Type: Trap Card
  Sub-Type: Continuous
  Text: Negate all other Trap effects on the field.

### Rulebook Context
[Section: 13. Chains and Spell Speed]
and Player B responds by activating their Set “Threatening Roar.” Then, Player A responds to that by activating “Seven Tools of the Bandit.” In this case, Chain Links are stacked up as following. • Chain Link 3 “Seven Tools of the Bandit” Negates the effect of “Threatening Roar” Spell Speed 3 • Chain Link 2 “Threatening Roar” Prevents the opponent from declaring attacks this turn. Spell Speed 2 • Chain Link 1 “Heavy Storm” Destroys all Spell and Trap Cards on the ﬁeld. Spell Speed 1 ”Seven Tools of the Bandit” (Chain Link 3) is resolved ﬁrst and negates the activation of “Threatening Roar.” “Threatening Roar” (Chain Link 2) would then be resolved, but the effect of “Seven Tools of the Bandit” stops its activation. The turn player will still be able to declare attacks. Then the effect of “Heavy Storm” (Chain Link 1) is resolved successfully, destroying all Spell and Trap Cards on the ﬁeld, allowing the turn player to attack without interference from Spell or Trap Cards. TURN PLAYER’S PRIORITY: The turn player always starts with Priority, or the choice to activate a card first, in each phase or step of their turn. As long as the turn player has Priority, the opponent cannot activate cards or effects, except for effects that activate automatically, like Trigger or Flip effects. The turn player can either: • Use Priority to play a card or activate an effect OR • Pass Priority to the opponent so they can activate an effect. A player must pass Priority to the opponent when moving on to the next phase or step. Strictly speaking, you would always declare that you’re passing Priority before the end of every phase and step, and ask your opponent if they wish to play a card. However, for ease of

[Section: 13. Chains and Spell Speed]
WHAT IS A CHAIN? Chains are a way to order the resolution of multiple card effects. They are used when the effects of more than 1 card are activated at once, or when a player wants to use an effect after a card has been played, but BEFORE that card has an effect on the game. If a card’s effect is activated, the opponent is always given a chance to respond with a card effect of their own, creating a Chain. If your opponent responds with an effect, then you can choose to respond and add another effect to the Chain. If your opponent does not respond, you may activate a second effect and create a Chain to your own card’s activation. Both players continue to add effects to the Chain until they both wish to add nothing else, then you resolve the outcome in reverse order – starting with the last card that was activated. You must always be careful not to resolve the effects of your cards before asking your opponent if they wish to make a Chain. SPELL SPEED: Every type of card effect has a Spell Speed between 1 and 3. If you want to respond to a card effect in a Chain, you have to use an effect with Spell Speed 2 or higher, and it cannot have a lower Spell Speed than the effect you are responding to. Spell Speeds: Spell, Trap, and Effect Monster effects have different Spell Speeds. There are Spell Speeds from 1 to 3. You can only respond with an effect if it is Spell Speed 2 or higher, and has an equal or greater Spell Speed than the effect on the Chain Link before it. • Spell Speed 1 Spells (Normal, Equip, Continuous, Field, Ritual), Effect Monster’s effects (Ignition,

from 1 to 3. You can only respond with an effect if it is Spell Speed 2 or higher, and has an equal or greater Spell Speed than the effect on the Chain Link before it. • Spell Speed 1 Spells (Normal, Equip, Continuous, Field, Ritual), Effect Monster’s effects (Ignition, Trigger, and Flip): This is the slowest of all Spell Speeds. These cards cannot be activated in response to any other effects. Typically, these effects cannot be Chain Link 2 or higher, unless multiple Spell Speed 1 effects are activated simultaneously. • Spell Speed 2 Traps (Normal, Continuous), Quick-Play Spells, Effect Monster’s Quick Effects: These cards can be used to respond to a Spell Speed 1 or 2 effect, and can typically be activated during any phase. • Spell Speed 3 Counter Traps: This is the fastest of all Spell Speeds and can be used to respond to a card of any Spell Speed. Only another Spell Speed 3 card may be used to respond to these cards. How a Chain Works: The ﬁrst effect activated is Chain Link 1. The next effect is Chain Link 2, and so on. Every time a new Chain Link is made, they are stacked up in the order that the cards are activated. Once the Chain is completed, the outcome is resolved starting with the most recent card to be activated at the top of the Chain and proceeding down to Chain Link 1. EXAMPLE OF A CHAIN: Player A plays “Heavy Storm” and Player B responds by activating their Set “Threatening Roar.” Then, Player A responds to that by activating “Seven Tools of the Bandit.” In this case, Chain Links are stacked up as following. • Chain Link 3 “Seven Tools of the Bandit” Negates the effect of “Threatening Roar” Spell Speed

an Xyz Monster is ﬂipped face-down, or becomes controlled by the opponent, the Xyz Materials are not sent to the Graveyard. They remain attached to the Xyz Monster. • Leaves the Field Some monsters have effects that activate when they “leave the ﬁeld”. For example, these effects activate when the monster is sent to the Graveyard, or is banished, or is returned to the hand or Extra Deck. When a monster on the ﬁeld is shufﬂed into the Deck, or becomes an Xyz Material, it is no longer a card on the ﬁeld, however its effects that activate when it “leaves the ﬁeld” will not activate. • Restrictions The restriction of “you cannot Normal or Special Summon the turn you activate this card” only refers to monsters that were successfully summoned. Same for “you can only Special Summon X once per turn” restrictions. • Trap Monsters Trap Monsters that say “This card is also still a Trap.” do not occupy both a Monster Zone and a Spell & Trap Zone. They are only in the Monster Zone (where the card actually is) and do not take up a Spell & Trap Zone.

found on Effect Monster Cards. Continuous Trap Cards can have effects that limit your opponent’s options, or that slowly damage your opponent’s LP. Counter Trap Cards: These Trap Cards are normally activated in response to the activation of other cards, and may have abilities like negating the effects of those cards. These types of Traps are effective against Normal Spell Cards or Normal Trap Cards, which are otherwise hard to stop, however many Counter Trap Cards require a cost to activate them. • The Difference between Set Spell Cards and Set Trap Cards: Spell Cards can be Set face-down on the ﬁeld like Trap Cards. However, the rules for the two types of cards are different. Spell Cards can be activated during the Main Phases even in the same turn that you Set them (except for Quick-Play Spell Cards). Setting them does not allow you to use them on your opponent’s turn; they still can only be activated during your Main Phase. You can Set a Spell Card face-down on the ﬁeld to bluff your opponent into thinking you have a powerful Trap.

NOT considered “destroyed.” • Discard Discard means to send a card from your hand to the Graveyard. This can happen because of a card effect or by adjusting the number of cards in your hand during the End Phase. • Effects of Cards The effect of a card is the special ability written on it, like the effect of a Spell, Trap, or Effect Monster. Costs that are needed to activate an ability are not part of the effect. The conditions that describe how to play a “Special Summon Monster” are also not an effect. • Equip Cards In addition to Equip Spell Cards, sometimes Trap Cards or Monster Cards can become equipped to a monster. Equipped Traps remain Trap Cards, but equipped monsters are considered to be Equip Spells. The term “Equip Card” includes all 3 kinds (standard Equip Spells, equipped Traps, and monsters equipped to other monsters). If a Monster Card is equipped to another monster, it remains equipped to that monster and cannot be moved to a different target, even by card effects that would normally be able to do so. EXCEPTION: Union monsters equipped by their own effects can be moved by appropriate card effects. • Equipped Monster A monster that is equipped with an Equip Card is an “equipped monster.” When this monster is destroyed or ﬂipped face-down, the equipped card loses its target, and is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard. • Excavate When a card says to “excavate” cards from your Deck, you reveal those cards to both players. Then, before you do anything else, apply the instructions from the card effect that excavated them. Cards that are being excavated are still treated as being in the Deck until sent elsewhere by the card instructions. • Original ATK (or DEF) The Original ATK

[Section: 4. XYZ MONSTERS]
Xyz Monsters (pronounced “ik-seez”) are a powerful kind of monster! You can Summon an Xyz Monster whenever you control monsters that are the same Level. Xyz Monsters start in your Extra Deck, not in your Main Deck, and wait for you to call them into action. Materials needed for an Xyz Summon: Xyz Monster’s Rank - This is the Rank of your Xyz Monster. Xyz Monsters have Ranks instead of Levels. Stronger Xyz Monsters have higher Ranks. This is a Rank 4 Xyz Monster. Xyz Materials - These are the Xyz Materials you need to Summon this monster. You use 2 Level 4 Monsters as the Xyz Materials to Summon this monster. Xyz Materials must be face-up before you can use them. HOW TO XYZ SUMMON: Xyz Summoning is your cool and easy way to Special Summon Xyz Monsters from your Extra Deck. Here’s how to do it! Choose an Xyz Monster from your Extra Deck that you have the right Xyz Materials for. The Xyz Materials should be face-up on your ﬁeld. During your Main Phase, declare that you are Xyz Summoning and stack the Xyz Materials on top of each other. Take the Xyz Monster from your Extra Deck and put it on top of the stacked Xyz Materials in the Extra Monster Zone or in the Main Monster Zone in face-up Attack or Defense Position. When an Xyz Monster tells you to “detach” a material, take one of the stacked Xyz Material cards beneath your Xyz Monster and put it in the Graveyard.

[Section: 2. LINK MONSTERS]
If 2 Extra Monster Zones are available, you can choose either one to Summon your monster. If there is a Link Monster already on the ﬁeld, you can Link Summon a monster in one of your zones it points to. LINK MONSTER BONUSES: Link Monsters already on the ﬁeld make great material! Normally, 1 monster equals 1 Link Material. But when you use a Link Monster as material for another Link Summon, you can count it as either 1 monster, or as a number of monsters equal to its Link Rating. For example, if you want to Summon a Link 3 monster that requires 2 or more materials in its “recipe”, you can either use 3 monsters (each counts as 1 material) or else a Link 2 Link Monster (counts as 1 or 2 materials) and a second monster (counts as 1 material). MORE ABOUT LINK MONSTERS: Link Monsters have no DEF and cannot ever be in Defense Position. They can’t be changed to Defense Position by a card effect. They can’t even be ﬂipped into face-down Defense Position. If your opponent has a monster in the Extra Monster Zone, it’s still a monster they control so you can’t attack directly. You have to battle and destroy all their monsters ﬁrst, including the one in the Extra Monster Zone. If you take control of your opponent’s monster in the Extra Monster Zone, it moves to your Main Monster Zone. When it goes back to your opponent, it goes to their Main Monster Zone, not the Extra Monster Zone. As long as the materials meet the requirements of the Link Monster you want to Summon, you can use a Token or Trap Card that is treated as a monster as the Link Material. Remember that when you Link Summon, you need

Main Monster Zone, not the Extra Monster Zone. As long as the materials meet the requirements of the Link Monster you want to Summon, you can use a Token or Trap Card that is treated as a monster as the Link Material. Remember that when you Link Summon, you need to meet 3 goals: • The amount of materials you use matches the Link Rating (Link Monsters count as 1 OR their own Link Rating). • The number of materials you use meets the number speciﬁed in the materials line or “recipe”. • The materials match any other requirements in the materials line (such as only Effect Monsters, or only a speciﬁc Type of monster).

### Game State
Player A Synchro summons ""Geomathmech Magma"". Player B activates ""Solemn Judgment"" to negate the summon and destroys ""Geomathmech Magma"".

### Query
Can the search effect of ""Geomathmech Magma"" be activated?

### Card Text
Geomathmech Magma:
  Card Type: Synchro Tuner Monster
  Sub-Type: Cyberse
  Text: 1 Tuner + 1+ non-Tuner monsters
When this card destroys a monster by battle: You can target up to 2 cards your opponent controls; destroy them. If this card is destroyed by battle, or if this card in its owner's possession is destroyed by an opponent's card effect: You can add 1 ""Mathmech"" Spell/Trap from your Deck to your hand. You can only use each effect of ""Geomathmech Magma"" once per turn.

Solemn Judgment:
  Card Type: Trap Card
  Sub-Type: Counter
  Text: When a monster(s) would be Summoned, OR a Spell/Trap Card is activated: Pay half your LP; negate the Summon or activation, and if you do, destroy that card.

### Rulebook Context
[Section: 15. Glossary]
reveal those cards to both players. Then, before you do anything else, apply the instructions from the card effect that excavated them. Cards that are being excavated are still treated as being in the Deck until sent elsewhere by the card instructions. • Original ATK (or DEF) The Original ATK (or DEF) is the number of ATK (or DEF) points printed on the Monster Card. This does not include an increase from an Equip Spell Card or other card effect. • Pay a Cost To pay a cost is an action required by a player in order to activate a card, an effect, or to Summon a monster. Tributing to Tribute Summon a Level 5 monster is an example of a cost. Other common costs are discarding, paying LP, or banishing cards. You have to pay any costs before you declare the activation of the card. Even if the activation of the card is negated, you cannot get a refund of the cost that you have paid. • Piercing Battle Damage Some monsters can inﬂict piercing battle damage when they attack a Defense Position monster. This means that you inﬂict damage to your opponent’s LP equal to the difference between the attacking monster’s ATK and the defending monster’s DEF. • Random When a card effect says to choose a card randomly, there is no ofﬁcial way of doing so, it is ﬁne as long as neither player has a way of knowing which card is being chosen. • Reveal When an effect says to reveal a card, you show it to both players. You may have to reveal a face-down card, a card from your hand, or from the top of your Deck. Revealing a card does not activate the card or its Flip effect. Normally, revealed cards are returned

NOT considered “destroyed.” • Discard Discard means to send a card from your hand to the Graveyard. This can happen because of a card effect or by adjusting the number of cards in your hand during the End Phase. • Effects of Cards The effect of a card is the special ability written on it, like the effect of a Spell, Trap, or Effect Monster. Costs that are needed to activate an ability are not part of the effect. The conditions that describe how to play a “Special Summon Monster” are also not an effect. • Equip Cards In addition to Equip Spell Cards, sometimes Trap Cards or Monster Cards can become equipped to a monster. Equipped Traps remain Trap Cards, but equipped monsters are considered to be Equip Spells. The term “Equip Card” includes all 3 kinds (standard Equip Spells, equipped Traps, and monsters equipped to other monsters). If a Monster Card is equipped to another monster, it remains equipped to that monster and cannot be moved to a different target, even by card effects that would normally be able to do so. EXCEPTION: Union monsters equipped by their own effects can be moved by appropriate card effects. • Equipped Monster A monster that is equipped with an Equip Card is an “equipped monster.” When this monster is destroyed or ﬂipped face-down, the equipped card loses its target, and is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard. • Excavate When a card says to “excavate” cards from your Deck, you reveal those cards to both players. Then, before you do anything else, apply the instructions from the card effect that excavated them. Cards that are being excavated are still treated as being in the Deck until sent elsewhere by the card instructions. • Original ATK (or DEF) The Original ATK

an Xyz Monster is ﬂipped face-down, or becomes controlled by the opponent, the Xyz Materials are not sent to the Graveyard. They remain attached to the Xyz Monster. • Leaves the Field Some monsters have effects that activate when they “leave the ﬁeld”. For example, these effects activate when the monster is sent to the Graveyard, or is banished, or is returned to the hand or Extra Deck. When a monster on the ﬁeld is shufﬂed into the Deck, or becomes an Xyz Material, it is no longer a card on the ﬁeld, however its effects that activate when it “leaves the ﬁeld” will not activate. • Restrictions The restriction of “you cannot Normal or Special Summon the turn you activate this card” only refers to monsters that were successfully summoned. Same for “you can only Special Summon X once per turn” restrictions. • Trap Monsters Trap Monsters that say “This card is also still a Trap.” do not occupy both a Monster Zone and a Spell & Trap Zone. They are only in the Monster Zone (where the card actually is) and do not take up a Spell & Trap Zone.

choose to attack with the same monster again, or choose to attack with a different monster, or choose not to attack at all. Note that if you attack with a different monster, the ﬁrst monster is still considered to have declared an attack, and it cannot attack again this turn. DAMAGE STEP RULES During the Damage Step, you can only activate Counter Trap Cards, or cards with effects that directly change a monster’s ATK or DEF. Also, these cards can only be activated up until the start of damage calculation. • Limitations on Activating Cards If you attack a face-down Defense Position monster, ﬂip the card to face-up Defense Position in the Damage Step. Now you can see the monster’s DEF and then calculate damage. • Attacking a Face-Down Card When an attacked monster is ﬂipped face-up, any Flip effects are activated and resolved after damage calculation. If you need to select a monster for the Flip effect to target, you cannot target a monster that has already been destroyed during damage calculation. • Activation of a Flip Effect During the Damage Step, there are limits on what cards you can activate. Also, during the Damage Step, Flip effects resolve a bit differently than they normally do. Main Phase 2: If you conducted your Battle Phase, your turn moves to Main Phase 2 afterwards. The actions a player can perform in this phase are the same as in Main Phase 1. However, if the player already did something in Main Phase 1 that has a limit to the number of times it can be done, the player cannot do it again in Main Phase 2. Consider if you want to activate and Set Spell & Trap Cards, or Summon or Set a monster (if you didn’t do that in Main

The turn player shouldannounce “I’m entering the Battle Phase.” Remember, the player who goes ﬁrst cannot conduct a Battle Phase in their very ﬁrst turn. • Battle Step: Select 1 monster on your side of the ﬁeld to attack with, and 1 of your opponent’s monsters as your attack target, and then declare the attack. If your opponent does not have any monsters on the ﬁeld, you can attack directly. Play then proceeds to the Damage Step. Afterwards, the attacking player returns to the Battle Step, and repeats this procedure. Each face-up Attack Position monster you control is allowed 1 attack per turn. You do not have to attack with a monster if you don’t want to. • Damage Step: In this step, the players calculate the result of the battle and whatever damage is done. After ﬁnishing the Damage Step, return to the Battle Step. • End Step: After you’ve resolved all your battles by repeating the Battle and Damage Steps, and you have no more monsters you want to attack with, announce to your opponent that you are ending your Battle Phase. Replay Rules during the Battle Step: After you’ve announced your attacking monster and the attack target monster during a Battle Step, the attack target might be removed from the ﬁeld, or a new monster may be played onto the opponent’s side of the ﬁeld before the Damage Step, due to a card’s effect. This causes a “Replay.” When this occurs, you can choose to attack with the same monster again, or choose to attack with a different monster, or choose not to attack at all. Note that if you attack with a different monster, the ﬁrst monster is still considered to have declared an attack, and it cannot attack again this turn.

You cannot change the battle position of a monster that was played onto the ﬁeld this turn. 2. You cannot change it in Main Phase 2 if the monster attacked during the Battle Phase. 3. You cannot change it if you have already changed its battle position once this turn. • Active a Card or Effect You can activate Spell and Trap Cards, or the effects of Spell, Trap, or Effect Monster Cards as many times as you want during this phase, as long as you can keep paying any costs involved. • Set Spell Cards and Trap Cards You can Set Spell and Trap Cards face-down in your Spell & Trap Zone during this phase, as long as you have space. Battle Phase: Now it’s time to battle with your Monster Cards! This phase is divided into steps. You do not have to conduct a Battle Phase every turn, even if you have a monster on the ﬁeld. IMPORTANT: The player who goes ﬁrst cannot conduct their Battle Phase on their ﬁrst turn. Possible Actions in this Phase. • Battle with monsters • Activate Trap Cards and Quick-Play Spell Cards The Battle Phase is split into 4 steps and is conducted in the following order: Note: The Battle Step and Damage Step are repeated each time you attack with a monster. • Start step. This step starts the Battle Phase. The turn player shouldannounce “I’m entering the Battle Phase.” Remember, the player who goes ﬁrst cannot conduct a Battle Phase in their very ﬁrst turn. • Battle Step: Select 1 monster on your side of the ﬁeld to attack with, and 1 of your opponent’s monsters

Note: When a card explains a special method to Tribute Summon a monster, you can also Tribute Set the monster by the same method. You can do as many of these during a turn as you want: • Flip Summon You can change a face-down Defense Position monster into face-up Attack Position, without using a card effect.

### Rulebook Context
[Section: 8. Summoning Monster Cards]
There are several ways to play monsters onto the ﬁeld. These ways can be categorized into 2 groups: actions that can be done only once per turn, and actions that can be done multiple times per turn. You can do one of these once per turn: • Normal Summon This is the most common way to Summon a monster. Simply play a Monster Card from your hand onto the ﬁeld in face-up Attack Position. All Normal Monsters, and most Effect Monsters (unless they have a speciﬁc restriction), can be Summoned in this way. • Normal Set To play a Monster Card from your hand in face-down Defense Position is called a Normal Set. A monster Normal Set on the ﬁeld is NOT considered Summoned. It has been Normal Set, and can be Summoned with a Flip Summon or ﬂipped face-up by an attack or card effect. Remember, you can only Normal Summon OR Normal Set (Normal Summon/Set, in short), once per turn, so if you Normal Set a monster you cannot also Normal Summon a monster that turn. Note: You cannot play a monster from your hand onto the ﬁeld in face-up Defense Position. • Tribute Summon For monsters that are Level 5 or higher, you must Tribute at least 1 monster you control before the Normal Summon/Set. This is called a Tribute Summon. Monsters that are Level 5 or 6 require 1 Tribute and Monsters that are Level 7 or higher require 2 Tributes. If you Tribute Summon in face-down Defense Position, it is called a Tribute Set. A monster Tribute Set on the ﬁeld is NOT considered Summoned. Note: When a card explains a special method to Tribute Summon a monster, you can also Tribute Set the monster by the same method. You can do as many of

For example, if a Synchro Monster is sent from your Extra Deck to the Graveyard without being Synchro Summoned, you cannot use a Spell Card to Special Summon it from the Graveyard, because Synchro Monsters have to be properly Special Summoned ﬁrst, before they can be Special Summoned by another card’s effect.

face-down Defense Position, it is called a Tribute Set. A monster Tribute Set on the ﬁeld is NOT considered Summoned. Note: When a card explains a special method to Tribute Summon a monster, you can also Tribute Set the monster by the same method. You can do as many of these during a turn as you want: • Flip Summon You can change a face-down Defense Position monster into face-up Attack Position, without using a card effect. This is called a Flip Summon. When you Flip Summon, you cannot change the monster to face-up Defense Position, only to face-up Attack Position. A Monster Card cannot be Flip Summoned in the same turn that it was Set onto the ﬁeld. You cannot use most monsters’ effects until they are face-up. • Special Summon Some monsters can be played onto the ﬁeld without being Normal Summoned or Set. This is called a Special Summon. Pendulum Summons, Xyz Summons, Synchro Summons, Fusion Summons and Ritual Summons are all Special Summons. Some Effect Monsters also have speciﬁc conditions that allow you to Special Summon them. Unless otherwise speciﬁed, a Special Summoned monster is played onto the ﬁeld in your choice of face-up Attack Position or face-up Defense Position. • Special Summon with a Card’s Effect Monsters can also be Special Summoned onto the ﬁeld through the effect of another card. This is different from “Special Summon Monsters.” You cannot use a card effect to Special Summon those monsters from your hand, Deck, or the Graveyard unless it was properly Special Summoned ﬁrst. For example, if a Synchro Monster is sent from your Extra Deck to the Graveyard without being Synchro Summoned, you cannot use a Spell Card to Special Summon it from the Graveyard, because Synchro Monsters have to be properly Special Summoned ﬁrst,

ﬁeld are treated as Normal Monsters. • Public Knowledge The number of cards in a player’s hand and Decks, the cards in their Graveyards, and each player’s current LP are all public knowledge and both players can verify these things at any time. If asked, you must answer these things to your opponent truthfully. You are allowed to pick up and verify the cards in your opponent’s Graveyard but you must ask their permission ﬁrst. Also, you may not change the order of the cards when verifying their Graveyard. • If both players conduct actions simultaneously For cases like “Each player targets 1 monster,” where both players resolve an effect simultaneously, the turn player resolves the effect ﬁrst. In this example, after the turn player makes their selection, the other player makes theirs. • When multiple cards are activated simultaneously If effects of Spell Speed 1 cards (like Trigger Effects) are activated at the same time, they will be resolved in a special Chain. This Chain is made starting with the turn player’s mandatory effects. If there is only 1 effect, that will be Chain Link 1. If there are 2 or more effects, the turn player builds the Chain starting with their mandatory effects, in any order. Then the opponent continues the Chain with their mandatory effects in any order. Afterwards, the turn player adds their optional effects in any order, and ﬁnally the opponent adds their optional effects in any order. • 0 ATK monsters Monsters with 0 ATK cannot destroy anything by battle. If two Attack Position monsters with 0 ATK battle each other, neither monster is destroyed. • Rules vs. Card Effects If there is a discrepancy between the basic rules and a card’s effect, the card effect takes precedence. For example, a monster can only

[Section: 1. Effect Monsters]
An Effect Monster is a monster that has special abilities. The effects of these monsters are split into four categories: • Continuous Effect • Ignition Effect • Quick Effect • Trigger Effect (including Flip) Continuous Effect: This effect is active while the Effect Monster Card is face-up on the ﬁeld. The effect starts when the face-up monster appears on the ﬁeld, and ends once that monster is gone or is no longer face-up; there is no trigger for its activation. These monsters are most useful if you have a strategy to protect them while they are on the ﬁeld. Example: Monsters with 2000 or less ATK cannot declare an attack. Ignition Effect: You use this type of effect just by declaring its activation during your Main Phase. There are some Ignition Effects that have a cost to activate, like discarding cards from your hand, Tributing a monster, or paying LP. Because you can choose when to activate this type of effect, it’s easy to create combos with them. Example: You can Tribute this card, then target 1 monster on the ﬁeld; destroy that target. Quick Effect: These are special monster effects that you can activate even during your opponent’s turn. These types of effects have a Spell Speed of 2, even though all other monster effects have a Spell Speed of 1. Since it’s difﬁcult for your opponent to predict these cards, they can give them an unexpected surprise. Example: When an effect is activated (Quick Effect): You can target 1 card in your Graveyard; Special Summon it. Trigger Effect: These effects are activated at speciﬁc times, such as “during the Standby Phase” or “when this monster is destroyed”. These cards can make for some great combos, but it’s easier for your opponent to predict what will happen, so they

These cards can make for some great combos, but it’s easier for your opponent to predict what will happen, so they might try to stop you. Example: When this card is destroyed by battle and sent to the Graveyard: Target 1 card on the ﬁeld; destroy that target. Flip Effect: Flip effect is a part of the Trigger Effect. This is an effect that is activated when a face-down card is ﬂipped face-up. This can happen when it is Flip Summoned, attacked while face-down, or ﬂipped face-up by a card effect. These effects start with the word “FLIP:” on the card. When you have a face-down monster, your opponent must be wary because they don’t know if it has a Flip effect or not. Example: FLIP: Draw 1 card.

### Rulebook Context
[Section: 5. SYNCHRO MONSTERS]
Synchro Monsters are placed in the Extra Deck, separate from the Main Deck. You can Special Summon a powerful Synchro Monster to the ﬁeld in an instant just by using the Levels of your monsters. They can be Synchro Summoned from the Extra Deck by sending 1 face-up “Tuner” monster and any number of face-up non-Tuner monsters from your ﬁeld to the Graveyard, when the sum of all their Levels is exactly equal to the Level of the Synchro Monster. TUNER MONSTERS FOR SYNCHRO SUMMON: In order to Synchro Summon a Synchro Monster, you need 1 Tuner (look for “Tuner” next to its Type). The Tuner monster and other face-up monsters you use for the Synchro Summon are called Synchro Materials. The sum of their Levels is the Level of Synchro Monster you can Summon. HOW TO SYNCHRO SUMMON: During your Main Phase, you can declare a Synchro Summon when the combined total Levels of 1 face-up Tuner monster and any number of other face-up monsters you control are equal to the Level of the Synchro Monster you want to Synchro Summon. After double-checking the Level of the Synchro Monster you want, send the face-up Synchro Materials from your ﬁeld to the Graveyard. After sending the Synchro Materials from the ﬁeld to the Graveyard, take the Synchro Monster from your Extra Deck and play it in the Extra Monster Zone or in the Main Monster Zone in face-up Attack or Defense Position.

[Section: 11. Turn Structure]
A Duel progresses in a series of turns which are divided into phases. Draw Phase: This is the ﬁrst phase. The player whose turn it is (the “turn player”) draws 1 card from the top of their Deck. A player with no cards left in their Deck and unable to draw loses the Duel. After you draw, Trap Cards or Quick-Play Spell Cards can be activated before proceeding to the Standby Phase. IMPORTANT: The player who goes ﬁrst cannot draw during the Draw Phase of their ﬁrst turn. Standby Phase: Some cards have effects that activate, or costs you must pay, in the Standby Phase. If you do not have any of these cards on the ﬁeld, you can still activate Trap Cards or Quick-Play Spell Cards before moving on to your Main Phase 1. Main Phase 1: This is when you play most of your cards: you can Normal Summon, Set, or change the battle position of a monster, activate a card’s effect, and Set Spell and Trap Cards. These actions can be done in any order you want, but some actions have restrictions. Possible Actions in this Phase. • Summon or Set a Monster There is no limit to the number of times you can Flip Summon or Special Summon during a turn, but you can only Normal Summon or Set a monster (including a Tribute Summon) once per turn. • Change Your Monsters’ Battle Positions. This includes Flip Summoning a monster, or changing the position of a face-up monster to face-up Attack or Defense Position. You can change the position of each monster you control, except in three cases. 1. You cannot change the battle position of a monster that was played onto the ﬁeld this turn. 2. You cannot change it in Main Phase 2 if

Use this phase to prepare for the opponent’s turn. Possible Actions in this Phase. • Summon or Set a monster • Change your monsters’ battle positions • Active a card or effect • Set Spell Cards and Trap Cards End Phase: Announce the end of your turn, and if there are any cards on the ﬁeld which say “…during the End Phase…” in their text, resolve those effects in this phase.

NOT considered “destroyed.” • Discard Discard means to send a card from your hand to the Graveyard. This can happen because of a card effect or by adjusting the number of cards in your hand during the End Phase. • Effects of Cards The effect of a card is the special ability written on it, like the effect of a Spell, Trap, or Effect Monster. Costs that are needed to activate an ability are not part of the effect. The conditions that describe how to play a “Special Summon Monster” are also not an effect. • Equip Cards In addition to Equip Spell Cards, sometimes Trap Cards or Monster Cards can become equipped to a monster. Equipped Traps remain Trap Cards, but equipped monsters are considered to be Equip Spells. The term “Equip Card” includes all 3 kinds (standard Equip Spells, equipped Traps, and monsters equipped to other monsters). If a Monster Card is equipped to another monster, it remains equipped to that monster and cannot be moved to a different target, even by card effects that would normally be able to do so. EXCEPTION: Union monsters equipped by their own effects can be moved by appropriate card effects. • Equipped Monster A monster that is equipped with an Equip Card is an “equipped monster.” When this monster is destroyed or ﬂipped face-down, the equipped card loses its target, and is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard. • Excavate When a card says to “excavate” cards from your Deck, you reveal those cards to both players. Then, before you do anything else, apply the instructions from the card effect that excavated them.

Text at the end of a sentence, after all colons and semi-colons, is what you do at resolution of the effect. • Control / Possess Cards you “control” are the cards in your Monster Zone, Spell & Trap Zone, Field Zone, and Pendulum Zone. Cards in your “possession” include all cards you control, plus the cards in your hand, Deck, Extra Deck, Graveyard, your banished cards, cards in the middle of being Summoned to your side of the ﬁeld, and Xyz Materials attached to monsters you control. If a player takes control of a card from their opponent, move it to the new controller’s side of the ﬁeld. If sent to the Graveyard, or returned to the hand or Deck, it is always returned to the Graveyard / hand / Deck of the original owner. • Destroy A card is destroyed when it is sent to the Graveyard due to battle between monsters or by an effect that destroys a card. A card that is returned from the ﬁeld to the hand or Deck, or, that is sent to the Graveyard as a cost or Tribute, is NOT considered “destroyed.” • Discard Discard means to send a card from your hand to the Graveyard.

You cannot use most monsters’ effects until they are face-up. • Special Summon Some monsters can be played onto the ﬁeld without being Normal Summoned or Set. This is called a Special Summon. Pendulum Summons, Xyz Summons, Synchro Summons, Fusion Summons and Ritual Summons are all Special Summons. Some Effect Monsters also have speciﬁc conditions that allow you to Special Summon them. Unless otherwise speciﬁed, a Special Summoned monster is played onto the ﬁeld in your choice of face-up Attack Position or face-up Defense Position. • Special Summon with a Card’s Effect Monsters can also be Special Summoned onto the ﬁeld through the effect of another card. This is different from “Special Summon Monsters.” You cannot use a card effect to Special Summon those monsters from your hand, Deck, or the Graveyard unless it was properly Special Summoned ﬁrst. For example, if a Synchro Monster is sent from your Extra Deck to the Graveyard without being Synchro Summoned, you cannot use a Spell Card to Special Summon it from the Graveyard, because Synchro Monsters have to be properly Special Summoned ﬁrst,

ATK cannot destroy anything by battle. If two Attack Position monsters with 0 ATK battle each other, neither monster is destroyed. • Rules vs. Card Effects If there is a discrepancy between the basic rules and a card’s effect, the card effect takes precedence. For example, a monster can only attack once per turn, but with a card effect, it is possible to attack twice. • Counters You may need to place these on cards for some card effects. You cannot place counters unless a card effect allows it. Cards may have effects that change with the number of counters on them, or require you to remove counters as a cost. Some counters have speciﬁc names, such as “Spell Counter” or “Clock Counter.” Other than their names, each individual counter itself does not have any effects. • Actions which cannot be Chained to You can only create a Chain by responding to the activation of a card or effect. Summoning a monster, Tributing, changing a monster’s battle position and paying costs are not effect activations and therefore you cannot respond to those actions using a Chain. • Xyz Materials Monsters that are used to Xyz Summon are called “Xyz Materials”, and are placed underneath the Xyz Monster, to show that they are attached to it. Monsters that have become Xyz Materials are not treated as cards on the ﬁeld. When an Xyz Monster leaves the ﬁeld, all of the Xyz Materials attached to it are sent to the Graveyard. If an Xyz Monster is ﬂipped face-down, or becomes controlled by the opponent, the Xyz Materials are not sent to the Graveyard. They remain attached to the Xyz Monster. • Leaves the Field Some monsters have effects that activate when they “leave the ﬁeld”. For example, these effects activate when the

### Rulebook Context
[Section: 11. Turn Structure]
A Duel progresses in a series of turns which are divided into phases. Draw Phase: This is the ﬁrst phase. The player whose turn it is (the “turn player”) draws 1 card from the top of their Deck. A player with no cards left in their Deck and unable to draw loses the Duel. After you draw, Trap Cards or Quick-Play Spell Cards can be activated before proceeding to the Standby Phase. IMPORTANT: The player who goes ﬁrst cannot draw during the Draw Phase of their ﬁrst turn. Standby Phase: Some cards have effects that activate, or costs you must pay, in the Standby Phase. If you do not have any of these cards on the ﬁeld, you can still activate Trap Cards or Quick-Play Spell Cards before moving on to your Main Phase 1. Main Phase 1: This is when you play most of your cards: you can Normal Summon, Set, or change the battle position of a monster, activate a card’s effect, and Set Spell and Trap Cards. These actions can be done in any order you want, but some actions have restrictions. Possible Actions in this Phase. • Summon or Set a Monster There is no limit to the number of times you can Flip Summon or Special Summon during a turn, but you can only Normal Summon or Set a monster (including a Tribute Summon) once per turn. • Change Your Monsters’ Battle Positions. This includes Flip Summoning a monster, or changing the position of a face-up monster to face-up Attack or Defense Position. You can change the position of each monster you control, except in three cases. 1. You cannot change the battle position of a monster that was played onto the ﬁeld this turn. 2. You cannot change it in Main Phase 2 if

Note: When a card explains a special method to Tribute Summon a monster, you can also Tribute Set the monster by the same method. You can do as many of these during a turn as you want: • Flip Summon You can change a face-down Defense Position monster into face-up Attack Position, without using a card effect. This is called a Flip Summon. When you Flip Summon, you cannot change the monster to face-up Defense Position, only to face-up Attack Position. A Monster Card cannot be Flip Summoned in the same turn that it was Set onto the ﬁeld. You cannot use most monsters’ effects until they are face-up. • Special Summon Some monsters can be played onto the ﬁeld without being Normal Summoned or Set. This is called a Special Summon. Pendulum Summons, Xyz Summons, Synchro Summons, Fusion Summons and Ritual Summons are all Special Summons. Some Effect Monsters also have speciﬁc conditions that allow you to Special Summon them. Unless otherwise speciﬁed, a Special Summoned monster is played onto the ﬁeld in your choice of face-up Attack Position or face-up Defense Position. • Special Summon with a Card’s Effect Monsters can also be Special Summoned onto the ﬁeld through the effect of another card.

[Section: 8. Summoning Monster Cards]
There are several ways to play monsters onto the ﬁeld. These ways can be categorized into 2 groups: actions that can be done only once per turn, and actions that can be done multiple times per turn. You can do one of these once per turn: • Normal Summon This is the most common way to Summon a monster. Simply play a Monster Card from your hand onto the ﬁeld in face-up Attack Position. All Normal Monsters, and most Effect Monsters (unless they have a speciﬁc restriction), can be Summoned in this way. • Normal Set To play a Monster Card from your hand in face-down Defense Position is called a Normal Set. A monster Normal Set on the ﬁeld is NOT considered Summoned. It has been Normal Set, and can be Summoned with a Flip Summon or ﬂipped face-up by an attack or card effect. Remember, you can only Normal Summon OR Normal Set (Normal Summon/Set, in short), once per turn, so if you Normal Set a monster you cannot also Normal Summon a monster that turn. Note: You cannot play a monster from your hand onto the ﬁeld in face-up Defense Position. • Tribute Summon For monsters that are Level 5 or higher, you must Tribute at least 1 monster you control before the Normal Summon/Set. This is called a Tribute Summon. Monsters that are Level 5 or 6 require 1 Tribute and Monsters that are Level 7 or higher require 2 Tributes. If you Tribute Summon in face-down Defense Position, it is called a Tribute Set. A monster Tribute Set on the ﬁeld is NOT considered Summoned. Note: When a card explains a special method to Tribute Summon a monster, you can also Tribute Set the monster by the same method. You can do as many of

NOT considered “destroyed.” • Discard Discard means to send a card from your hand to the Graveyard. This can happen because of a card effect or by adjusting the number of cards in your hand during the End Phase. • Effects of Cards The effect of a card is the special ability written on it, like the effect of a Spell, Trap, or Effect Monster. Costs that are needed to activate an ability are not part of the effect. The conditions that describe how to play a “Special Summon Monster” are also not an effect. • Equip Cards In addition to Equip Spell Cards, sometimes Trap Cards or Monster Cards can become equipped to a monster. Equipped Traps remain Trap Cards, but equipped monsters are considered to be Equip Spells. The term “Equip Card” includes all 3 kinds (standard Equip Spells, equipped Traps, and monsters equipped to other monsters). If a Monster Card is equipped to another monster, it remains equipped to that monster and cannot be moved to a different target, even by card effects that would normally be able to do so. EXCEPTION: Union monsters equipped by their own effects can be moved by appropriate card effects. • Equipped Monster A monster that is equipped with an Equip Card is an “equipped monster.” When this monster is destroyed or ﬂipped face-down, the equipped card loses its target, and is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard. • Excavate When a card says to “excavate” cards from your Deck, you reveal those cards to both players. Then, before you do anything else, apply the instructions from the card effect that excavated them. Cards that are being excavated are still treated as being in the Deck until sent elsewhere by the card instructions. • Original ATK (or DEF) The Original ATK

the cards on the Game Mat other than the Graveyard, Deck, and Extra Deck. • Colon (:) and Semi-colon (;) Card effects are sometimes separated with a colon (:) and/or semi-colon (;). Text before the colon gives information on conditions to activate the effect, and timing on when it happens. Text before a semi-colon is what you do when the effect is activated. Text at the end of a sentence, after all colons and semi-colons, is what you do at resolution of the effect. • Control / Possess Cards you “control” are the cards in your Monster Zone, Spell & Trap Zone, Field Zone, and Pendulum Zone. Cards in your “possession” include all cards you control, plus the cards in your hand, Deck, Extra Deck, Graveyard, your banished cards, cards in the middle of being Summoned to your side of the ﬁeld, and Xyz Materials attached to monsters you control. If a player takes control of a card from their opponent, move it to the new controller’s side of the ﬁeld. If sent to the Graveyard, or returned to the hand or Deck, it is always returned to the Graveyard / hand / Deck of the original owner. • Destroy A card is destroyed when it is sent to the Graveyard due to battle between monsters or by an effect that destroys a card. A card that is returned from the ﬁeld to the hand or Deck, or, that is sent to the Graveyard as a cost or Tribute, is NOT considered “destroyed.” • Discard Discard means to send a card from your hand to the Graveyard.

[Section: 5. SYNCHRO MONSTERS]
Synchro Monsters are placed in the Extra Deck, separate from the Main Deck. You can Special Summon a powerful Synchro Monster to the ﬁeld in an instant just by using the Levels of your monsters. They can be Synchro Summoned from the Extra Deck by sending 1 face-up “Tuner” monster and any number of face-up non-Tuner monsters from your ﬁeld to the Graveyard, when the sum of all their Levels is exactly equal to the Level of the Synchro Monster. TUNER MONSTERS FOR SYNCHRO SUMMON: In order to Synchro Summon a Synchro Monster, you need 1 Tuner (look for “Tuner” next to its Type). The Tuner monster and other face-up monsters you use for the Synchro Summon are called Synchro Materials. The sum of their Levels is the Level of Synchro Monster you can Summon. HOW TO SYNCHRO SUMMON: During your Main Phase, you can declare a Synchro Summon when the combined total Levels of 1 face-up Tuner monster and any number of other face-up monsters you control are equal to the Level of the Synchro Monster you want to Synchro Summon. After double-checking the Level of the Synchro Monster you want, send the face-up Synchro Materials from your ﬁeld to the Graveyard. After sending the Synchro Materials from the ﬁeld to the Graveyard, take the Synchro Monster from your Extra Deck and play it in the Extra Monster Zone or in the Main Monster Zone in face-up Attack or Defense Position.

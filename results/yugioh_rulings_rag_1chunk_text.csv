and Player B responds by activating their Set “Threatening Roar.” Then, Player A responds to that by activating “Seven Tools of the Bandit.” In this case, Chain Links are stacked up as following. • Chain Link 3 “Seven Tools of the Bandit” Negates the effect of “Threatening Roar” Spell Speed 3 • Chain Link 2 “Threatening Roar” Prevents the opponent from declaring attacks this turn. Spell Speed 2 • Chain Link 1 “Heavy Storm” Destroys all Spell and Trap Cards on the ﬁeld. Spell Speed 1 ”Seven Tools of the Bandit” (Chain Link 3) is resolved ﬁrst and negates the activation of “Threatening Roar.” “Threatening Roar” (Chain Link 2) would then be resolved, but the effect of “Seven Tools of the Bandit” stops its activation. The turn player will still be able to declare attacks. Then the effect of “Heavy Storm” (Chain Link 1) is resolved successfully, destroying all Spell and Trap Cards on the ﬁeld, allowing the turn player to attack without interference from Spell or Trap Cards. TURN PLAYER’S PRIORITY: The turn player always starts with Priority, or the choice to activate a card first, in each phase or step of their turn. As long as the turn player has Priority, the opponent cannot activate cards or effects, except for effects that activate automatically, like Trigger or Flip effects. The turn player can either: • Use Priority to play a card or activate an effect OR • Pass Priority to the opponent so they can activate an effect. A player must pass Priority to the opponent when moving on to the next phase or step. Strictly speaking, you would always declare that you’re passing Priority before the end of every phase and step, and ask your opponent if they wish to play a card. However, for ease of

Note: When a card explains a special method to Tribute Summon a monster, you can also Tribute Set the monster by the same method. You can do as many of these during a turn as you want: • Flip Summon You can change a face-down Defense Position monster into face-up Attack Position, without using a card effect. This is called a Flip Summon. When you Flip Summon, you cannot change the monster to face-up Defense Position, only to face-up Attack Position. A Monster Card cannot be Flip Summoned in the same turn that it was Set onto the ﬁeld. You cannot use most monsters’ effects until they are face-up. • Special Summon Some monsters can be played onto the ﬁeld without being Normal Summoned or Set. This is called a Special Summon. Pendulum Summons, Xyz Summons, Synchro Summons, Fusion Summons and Ritual Summons are all Special Summons. Some Effect Monsters also have speciﬁc conditions that allow you to Special Summon them. Unless otherwise speciﬁed, a Special Summoned monster is played onto the ﬁeld in your choice of face-up Attack Position or face-up Defense Position. • Special Summon with a Card’s Effect Monsters can also be Special Summoned onto the ﬁeld through the effect of another card. This is different from “Special Summon Monsters.” You cannot use a card effect to Special Summon those monsters from your hand, Deck, or the Graveyard unless it was properly Special Summoned ﬁrst.

### Rulebook Context
[Section: 8. Summoning Monster Cards]
There are several ways to play monsters onto the ﬁeld. These ways can be categorized into 2 groups: actions that can be done only once per turn, and actions that can be done multiple times per turn. You can do one of these once per turn: • Normal Summon This is the most common way to Summon a monster. Simply play a Monster Card from your hand onto the ﬁeld in face-up Attack Position. All Normal Monsters, and most Effect Monsters (unless they have a speciﬁc restriction), can be Summoned in this way. • Normal Set To play a Monster Card from your hand in face-down Defense Position is called a Normal Set. A monster Normal Set on the ﬁeld is NOT considered Summoned. It has been Normal Set, and can be Summoned with a Flip Summon or ﬂipped face-up by an attack or card effect. Remember, you can only Normal Summon OR Normal Set (Normal Summon/Set, in short), once per turn, so if you Normal Set a monster you cannot also Normal Summon a monster that turn. Note: You cannot play a monster from your hand onto the ﬁeld in face-up Defense Position. • Tribute Summon For monsters that are Level 5 or higher, you must Tribute at least 1 monster you control before the Normal Summon/Set. This is called a Tribute Summon. Monsters that are Level 5 or 6 require 1 Tribute and Monsters that are Level 7 or higher require 2 Tributes. If you Tribute Summon in face-down Defense Position, it is called a Tribute Set. A monster Tribute Set on the ﬁeld is NOT considered Summoned. Note: When a card explains a special method to Tribute Summon a monster, you can also Tribute Set the monster by the same method. You can do as many of

If asked, you must answer these things to your opponent truthfully. You are allowed to pick up and verify the cards in your opponent’s Graveyard but you must ask their permission ﬁrst. Also, you may not change the order of the cards when verifying their Graveyard. • If both players conduct actions simultaneously For cases like “Each player targets 1 monster,” where both players resolve an effect simultaneously, the turn player resolves the effect ﬁrst. In this example, after the turn player makes their selection, the other player makes theirs. • When multiple cards are activated simultaneously If effects of Spell Speed 1 cards (like Trigger Effects) are activated at the same time, they will be resolved in a special Chain. This Chain is made starting with the turn player’s mandatory effects. If there is only 1 effect, that will be Chain Link 1. If there are 2 or more effects, the turn player builds the Chain starting with their mandatory effects, in any order. Then the opponent continues the Chain with their mandatory effects in any order. Afterwards, the turn player adds their optional effects in any order, and ﬁnally the opponent adds their optional effects in any order. • 0 ATK monsters Monsters with 0 ATK cannot destroy anything by battle.

Synchro Monsters are placed in the Extra Deck, separate from the Main Deck. You can Special Summon a powerful Synchro Monster to the ﬁeld in an instant just by using the Levels of your monsters. They can be Synchro Summoned from the Extra Deck by sending 1 face-up “Tuner” monster and any number of face-up non-Tuner monsters from your ﬁeld to the Graveyard, when the sum of all their Levels is exactly equal to the Level of the Synchro Monster. TUNER MONSTERS FOR SYNCHRO SUMMON: In order to Synchro Summon a Synchro Monster, you need 1 Tuner (look for “Tuner” next to its Type). The Tuner monster and other face-up monsters you use for the Synchro Summon are called Synchro Materials. The sum of their Levels is the Level of Synchro Monster you can Summon. HOW TO SYNCHRO SUMMON: During your Main Phase, you can declare a Synchro Summon when the combined total Levels of 1 face-up Tuner monster and any number of other face-up monsters you control are equal to the Level of the Synchro Monster you want to Synchro Summon. After double-checking the Level of the Synchro Monster you want, send the face-up Synchro Materials from your ﬁeld to the Graveyard.

Costs that are needed to activate an ability are not part of the effect. The conditions that describe how to play a “Special Summon Monster” are also not an effect. • Equip Cards In addition to Equip Spell Cards, sometimes Trap Cards or Monster Cards can become equipped to a monster. Equipped Traps remain Trap Cards, but equipped monsters are considered to be Equip Spells. The term “Equip Card” includes all 3 kinds (standard Equip Spells, equipped Traps, and monsters equipped to other monsters). If a Monster Card is equipped to another monster, it remains equipped to that monster and cannot be moved to a different target, even by card effects that would normally be able to do so. EXCEPTION: Union monsters equipped by their own effects can be moved by appropriate card effects. • Equipped Monster A monster that is equipped with an Equip Card is an “equipped monster.” When this monster is destroyed or ﬂipped face-down, the equipped card loses its target, and is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard. • Excavate When a card says to “excavate” cards from your Deck, you reveal those cards to both players.

A Duel progresses in a series of turns which are divided into phases. Draw Phase: This is the ﬁrst phase. The player whose turn it is (the “turn player”) draws 1 card from the top of their Deck. A player with no cards left in their Deck and unable to draw loses the Duel. After you draw, Trap Cards or Quick-Play Spell Cards can be activated before proceeding to the Standby Phase. IMPORTANT: The player who goes ﬁrst cannot draw during the Draw Phase of their ﬁrst turn. Standby Phase: Some cards have effects that activate, or costs you must pay, in the Standby Phase. If you do not have any of these cards on the ﬁeld, you can still activate Trap Cards or Quick-Play Spell Cards before moving on to your Main Phase 1. Main Phase 1: This is when you play most of your cards: you can Normal Summon, Set, or change the battle position of a monster, activate a card’s effect, and Set Spell and Trap Cards. These actions can be done in any order you want, but some actions have restrictions. Possible Actions in this Phase. • Summon or Set a Monster There is no limit to the number of times you can Flip Summon or Special Summon during a turn, but you can only Normal Summon or Set a monster (including a Tribute Summon) once per turn. • Change Your Monsters’ Battle Positions. This includes Flip Summoning a monster, or changing the position of a face-up monster to face-up Attack or Defense Position.

### Card Text

### Rulebook Context
[Section: 15. Glossary]
NOT considered “destroyed.” • Discard Discard means to send a card from your hand to the Graveyard. This can happen because of a card effect or by adjusting the number of cards in your hand during the End Phase. • Effects of Cards The effect of a card is the special ability written on it, like the effect of a Spell, Trap, or Effect Monster. Costs that are needed to activate an ability are not part of the effect. The conditions that describe how to play a “Special Summon Monster” are also not an effect. • Equip Cards In addition to Equip Spell Cards, sometimes Trap Cards or Monster Cards can become equipped to a monster. Equipped Traps remain Trap Cards, but equipped monsters are considered to be Equip Spells. The term “Equip Card” includes all 3 kinds (standard Equip Spells, equipped Traps, and monsters equipped to other monsters). If a Monster Card is equipped to another monster, it remains equipped to that monster and cannot be moved to a different target, even by card effects that would normally be able to do so. EXCEPTION: Union monsters equipped by their own effects can be moved by appropriate card effects. • Equipped Monster A monster that is equipped with an Equip Card is an “equipped monster.” When this monster is destroyed or ﬂipped face-down, the equipped card loses its target, and is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard. • Excavate When a card says to “excavate” cards from your Deck, you reveal those cards to both players. Then, before you do anything else, apply the instructions from the card effect that excavated them. Cards that are being excavated are still treated as being in the Deck until sent elsewhere by the card instructions. • Original ATK (or DEF) The Original ATK

### Rulebook Context
[Section: 5. SYNCHRO MONSTERS]
Synchro Monsters are placed in the Extra Deck, separate from the Main Deck. You can Special Summon a powerful Synchro Monster to the ﬁeld in an instant just by using the Levels of your monsters. They can be Synchro Summoned from the Extra Deck by sending 1 face-up “Tuner” monster and any number of face-up non-Tuner monsters from your ﬁeld to the Graveyard, when the sum of all their Levels is exactly equal to the Level of the Synchro Monster. TUNER MONSTERS FOR SYNCHRO SUMMON: In order to Synchro Summon a Synchro Monster, you need 1 Tuner (look for “Tuner” next to its Type). The Tuner monster and other face-up monsters you use for the Synchro Summon are called Synchro Materials. The sum of their Levels is the Level of Synchro Monster you can Summon. HOW TO SYNCHRO SUMMON: During your Main Phase, you can declare a Synchro Summon when the combined total Levels of 1 face-up Tuner monster and any number of other face-up monsters you control are equal to the Level of the Synchro Monster you want to Synchro Summon. After double-checking the Level of the Synchro Monster you want, send the face-up Synchro Materials from your ﬁeld to the Graveyard. After sending the Synchro Materials from the ﬁeld to the Graveyard, take the Synchro Monster from your Extra Deck and play it in the Extra Monster Zone or in the Main Monster Zone in face-up Attack or Defense Position.
